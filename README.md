## Quick start

Point it at a folder of markdown projects and browse them:

```bash
npx vibedocs serve --root ./projects
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. No config file, no database, no build step — you get search, live reload as you edit, syntax highlighting, mermaid diagrams and a dark-mode toggle.

When you want to publish instead of browse, render a project to a static site:

```bash
VIBEDOCS_ROOT=./projects npx vibedocs build --project my-project --out ./site
```

That output is plain HTML with self-hosted full-text search and an installable PWA — deploy it to any static host. Add `--serve` instead of `--out` to preview the built site locally.

Prefer a permanent install? `npm install -g vibedocs`.

### Supported platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Linux | ✅ Tested in CI on every push |
| macOS | ✅ Tested in CI on every push |
| Windows | ⚠️ Not yet supported — untested |

Node.js 20 or newer. Windows isn't blocked — the CLI prints a notice and runs anyway — but nothing verifies it, so treat it as unsupported until it's in the CI matrix. [Reports of what breaks](https://github.com/danielcbright/vibedocs/issues) are what will move it.

The repo ships with a `demo/` workspace (three fictional Cirrus Weather projects) so you can try the app without your own markdown:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielcbright/vibedocs.git
cd vibedocs
VIBEDOCS_ROOT=$(pwd)/demo npm start
```

## What you get

- **Auto-discovery** — point at a directory of projects and VibeDocs finds the markdown
- **Live reload** — edits to `.md` files appear instantly via WebSocket
- **Syntax highlighting** — Shiki with dual light/dark themes

  ![Dark mode with Shiki dual theme](docs/screenshots/dark-mode.png)

- **Mermaid diagrams** — fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks render inline

  ![Mermaid diagram rendered in a doc](docs/screenshots/mermaid.png)

- **Full-text search** — Ctrl+K command palette with instant results

  ![Search dialog with results for "forecast"](docs/screenshots/search.png)

- **Mobile-first layout** — hamburger drawer + bottom-sheet TOC

  ![Mobile layout at iPhone width](docs/screenshots/mobile.png)

- **Table of contents** — auto-generated from headings with scroll-spy
- **Dark / light / system theme** — toggle in one click
- **File upload** (opt-in) — bearer-token-gated upload endpoint, hidden when disabled
- **GFM** — tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks

## Two render modes

VibeDocs has two ways to serve docs:

| Mode | Command | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| **Live** | `npm start` (or `vibedocs`) | The interactive app — search, live reload, theme toggle. Run it against a directory you're actively editing. |
| **Static build** | `npx vibedocs build --serve` | Publish to a static host. Outputs plain HTML with rendered Shiki + tables. Add `--hydration minimal` to ship ~500 KB less JS per page (no search dialog, system theme only). |

Both modes share the same renderer (one source of truth for HTML output).

## How it works

A thin Hono backend watches files, owns the AppState (single in-memory source of project trees + render results), and serves rendered HTML. A React 19 frontend reads from it. Inter-doc links are normalized in a single pass by the URL Rewriter — same code path for both render modes. See [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) for the domain language and [ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-appstate-shape.md) for the AppState shape rationale.

## Demo workspace

The `demo/` directory ships with three fictional projects so you can try VibeDocs without setting up your own:

- **`cirrus-api/`** — REST API reference with mermaid diagrams, error tables, and per-endpoint pages
- **`cirrus-sdk/`** — TypeScript / Python / Go SDK docs with typed code samples
- **`cirrus-dashboard/`** — UI component library docs with prop tables and design tokens

```bash
VIBEDOCS_ROOT=$(pwd)/demo npm start
```

The demo content is entirely fictional (`stratus-key-DEMO-12345`, `https://api.cirrus.example.com`). Nothing in it references a real product.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VIBEDOCS_ROOT` | current working directory | Root directory to scan for projects |
| `VIBEDOCS_ROOTS` | _(unset)_ | Several roots, colon-separated (POSIX). Wins over `VIBEDOCS_ROOT` when both are set. See "Several roots" below. |
| `VIBEDOCS_PORT` or `PORT` | `8080` | Port to listen on |
| `VIBEDOCS_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | _(unset)_ | Comma-separated extra Origin allowlist for the WebSocket handshake. Defaults cover `localhost`. |
| `VIBEDOCS_WS_ALLOW_NO_ORIGIN` | `false` | Accept WS handshakes with no `Origin` header (non-browser clients) |
| `VIBEDOCS_UPLOAD_TOKEN` | _(unset)_ | Bearer token gating `POST /api/upload/*`. When unset, upload endpoint 404s. |
| `VIBEDOCS_READ_ONLY` | `false` | Force read-only mode — upload endpoint 404s even with a valid token |
| `VIBEDOCS_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | `10485760` (10 MB) | Per-file upload size cap |

## Directory layout

`VIBEDOCS_ROOT` should contain project directories, each with markdown files:

```
$VIBEDOCS_ROOT/
├── project-a/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── CLAUDE.md
│   └── docs/
│       ├── getting-started.md
│       └── api-reference.md
├── project-b/
│   ├── README.md
│   └── docs/
│       └── architecture.md
└── ...
```

Each subdirectory becomes a "project" in the sidebar. Root-level `.md` files and everything under `docs/` are displayed.

### Several roots

To serve projects from more than one place — say code docs and personal notes —
list the roots colon-separated:

```bash
VIBEDOCS_ROOTS="$HOME/Development:$HOME/Notes" vibedocs serve
```

Projects from every root appear in one flat list, ordered by root. A project
keeps its plain folder name; only a name offered by two roots is disambiguated,
and only for the later one — `notes` from the first root stays `notes`, while
`notes` from a root called `Notes` becomes `notes~Notes`. That asymmetry is the
point: **adding a root never renames an existing project**, so saved links keep
working. (Adding one at the *front* of the list can rename, so append.)

Two configurations are refused at startup, with the reason, because both are
silently wrong rather than merely unusual:

- **Roots sharing a basename** (`~/a/docs` and `~/b/docs`) — a project found in
  both would want the same disambiguated name.
- **A root inside another root** (`~/a` and `~/a/b`) — everything under the inner
  one would be listed twice under two names, and every file change would fire
  twice.

Colon is the separator on Linux and macOS, which are the supported platforms.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev   # Backend (8080) + Vite dev server (5173) with HMR
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to the backend, giving you hot module reload for frontend changes and auto-restart for backend changes.

```bash
npm run dev:server    # Backend only
npm run dev:frontend  # Frontend only
npm test              # Run tests (vitest)
npm run build         # Build the frontend bundle
```

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** [Hono](https://hono.dev/) + TypeScript + Node.js 20+
- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite + [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Markdown:** unified / remark / rehype pipeline
- **Syntax highlighting:** [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) (dual-theme via CSS variables)
- **Diagrams:** [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/) (lazy-loaded, zero cost on diagram-free pages)
- **Live reload:** [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) + WebSocket

## Deployment

VibeDocs is designed to run as a persistent service. A systemd unit file is included in `systemd/vibedocs.service` — edit the paths and run `scripts/setup-service.sh` to install it.

See `scripts/promote.sh` for a build-validate-restart workflow.

When exposing beyond localhost (tailnet, LAN, public), set `VIBEDOCS_WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to every URL the browser will load the app from — otherwise live reload silently fails (this is intentional: it blocks cross-site WebSocket hijacking).

## Documentation

- [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) — domain language and architecture overview (AppState seam, ports/adapters split, Render Modes, URL Rewriter)
- [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) — architectural decision records
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — project memory and conventions for Claude Code sessions

## Built in collaboration with Claude Code

VibeDocs was built in collaboration with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — Anthropic's agentic coding tool. Every line of the Hono backend, the unified markdown pipeline, the React frontend with shadcn/ui components, and the test suite came out of conversational sessions with Claude.

Deep adversarial reviews — stress-testing architectural plans, surfacing failure modes, grilling design assumptions before they shipped — came from **Grok 4.x**. Several of the decisions recorded in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) and the audit work in v0.2.0 were shaped by that two-model loop: Claude proposes, Grok pushes back, the design that lands is whatever survives both rounds. See [`docs/arch-viz-adversarial-review.md`](docs/arch-viz-adversarial-review.md) and [`docs/arch-viz-grounded-response.md`](docs/arch-viz-grounded-response.md) for one example of that pattern in action.

It started as a one-shot "show me my markdown" viewer and grew iteratively: discovery, rendering, search, live reload, theming, table of contents, then two render modes, the AppState consolidation, and the URL Rewriter — each one a focused session. The [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) file in this repo is the project memory that ties those sessions together.
